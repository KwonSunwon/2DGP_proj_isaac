--Pseudo lua code for getting the number of rooms for a floor.

--Pseudo lua code for getting the number of deadends a floor must have.

MinDeadEnds = 5
if StageId ~= 1 then
 MinDeadEnds += 1
end

--Deadends are sorted by distance from the starting room descending.
--e.g. Boss room is placed in the farthest deadend, super secret is placed in the next farthest deadend

--DequeueDeadend also resizes the deadend. This is important to note because that means most deadends get changed to a 1x1 by the end of this.

PlaceRoom(ROOM_BOSS, DequeueDeadend())

--Treasure
if StageId < 7 or (StageId < 9 and HasTrinket(BloodyCrown)) then
	PlaceRoom(ROOM_TREASURE, DequeueDeadend())
end

-- Grave Room
if StageId == 11 and StageType == 0 then --Dark Room
	PlaceGrave(DequeueDeadend())
end
